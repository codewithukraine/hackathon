# Problem Statement
The idea is to help Ukrainian families escaping the war as refugees to find sanctuary and hosts in nearby countries immediately surrounding Ukraine’s western border: Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Slovakia. The people are stressed, thus filling out forms or sifting through multiple listings and requesting a booking. That's why we're in dire need a few great minds to help build an app for refugees that will enable them to be instantly paired with hosts or sponsors.

# Hackathon
Participants will collaborate on creating a web application where refugees can pair with a host or find a place right away by simply entering the number of people and the nearest city to which they are located (or use Location settings). Sponsors will enter a different side of the app which let's them see the "asks" of the refugees and proceed to claim & reserve a place. For example, an AirBnb listing matched the recent needs of a family escaping the war (2 adults, 1 child). This matched bid will become available for sponsors looking to fund and help people escape the war. Once a bid is "funded" by a sponsor, the hosts (the AirBnb short term rental owners) can be contacted via Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or a number they have provided on their listing. Aside from scraping nearby availibilities from APIs such as AirBnB, sponsors should be able to list their own rooms easily as well.

* The application should remain stateless and not store any conversations or data from hosts or refugees.
* Protect against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and anti-web scraping technology and other cyber attacks

# Hackathon Agenda
We’re not asking for a complete product, but the smallest subset which can still bring enough value to refugees escaping the war and for the open source community to stay engaged.

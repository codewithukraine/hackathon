# Problem Statement
The idea is to help Ukrainian families escaping the war as refugees to find sanctuary and hosts in nearby countries immediately surrounding Ukraine’s western border: Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Slovakia. The people are stressed, thus filling out forms on government websites and waiting for a response is not the right approach. Let’s take the great minds in RBC and apply our skills to help families under attack.

# Hackathon
Participants will collaborate to create a web application where refugees can simply enter the number of people and the nearest city to which they are located (or use Location settings). Without manually sifting through lists of nearby hosts a match will be selected based on the number of people and time of stay. Sponsors will enter a different side of the app which let's them see the "asks" of the refugees and proceed to claim & reserve a place for the refugees. For example, an AirBnb listing matched the needs of a family escaping the war (2 adults, 1 child) and this bid will become available for sponsors looking to fund and help innocent people escape the war.

Once a bid is funded by a sponsor, the hosts (the AirBnb short term rental owners) can be contacted via Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or a number they have provided on their listing. Aside from scraping nearby availibilities from APIs such as AirBnB, sponsors should be able to list their own rooms easily as well.

* The application should remain stateless and not store any conversations or data from hosts or refugees.
* Protect against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and anti-web scraping technology and other cyber attacks

# Hackathon Agenda
Tomorrow, we’re not asking for a complete product, but the smallest subset which can still bring enough value to refugees escaping the war and for the open source community to stay engaged.
